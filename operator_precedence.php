	// There are multiple types of operators such as assignment, concatenation, comparision, arithmetic, logical operators

	// But we are going to learn about their precedence

	$x = 5 + 3 * 5;
	echo $x;

	#the answer is going to be 20 because the multiplication operator has more precedence over addition and subtraction that's why it executes first
	#Assignment operator has the lowest precedence:

	# we can force increase the precedence of an expression by putting the expression in parenthesis so it will execute earlier thatn other
